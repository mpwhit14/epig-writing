####Pronouns

A **pronoun** is a word that can replace a noun.  For example, instead of saying "Caesar did this" and "Caesar did that" over and over again, we can replace "Caesar" with the pronoun "he".  Like Latin nouns, Latin pronouns have a **case**, **number**, and **gender**, and these three characteristics are expressed by different forms of the pronoun.

Pronouns that refer to people are called **personal pronouns** (that is, I, you, we).  Here are the Latin forms for personal pronouns:

*ego*, I
Case | Singular | Plural
Nominative | *ego* (I) | *nos* (we)
Genitive | *mei* (of me) | *noster* (of us)
Dative | *mihi* (to/for me) | *nobis* (to/for us)
Accusative | *me* (me) | *nos* (us)
Ablative | *me* (by/with me) | *nobis* (by/with us)

*tu*, you
Case | Singular | Plural
Nominative | *tu* (you) | *vos* (you all)
Genitive | *tui* (of you) | *vester* (of you)
Dative | *tibi* (to/for you) | *vobis* (to/for you)
Accusative | *te* (you) | *vos* (you)
Ablative | *te* (by/with you) | *vobis* (by/with you)
