####Nominative

The first case we will look at is the **{nominative}[nom]** case.  The nominative is the case for the subject of a sentence.  If we look back at our dictionary entry:  *puella, puellae f.*  The first word in the entry, *puella*, is the nominative singular form of the word.  

[nom]: urn:cite:hclat:category.nominative

Many ancient Roman coins use only words in the nominative.  These nominative forms are acting as the caption of the picture on the coin, or declaring who the emperor was at the time the coin was made, etc.  The nominative forms are not being acted upon, they are simply saying that something exists.

The ending of each noun is attached to the **stem** of the noun.  The stem of the noun is everything before the ending in the second word of the dictionary entry:
		*puella, puell||ae f.*

So, for *puella, puellae f.*, the stem is *puell-*.

The following are the nominative singular and plural endings for the first three declensions:
