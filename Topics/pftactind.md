####The Perfect Active Indicative

There are six tenses in Latin, but this section focuses only on one:  the **perfect** tense.  The perfect tense is similar to the past tense in English.  The difference is that English has one tense to express everything that happened in the past, and Latin has two.  Latin distinguished between two different types of past action - action that happened in the past and continued to happen, and action that happened in the past and is completed.  For example, this is an English example of continued past action:

While I was eating breakfast, my mother *was sitting*.

My mother sat down once, in the past, and then continued to sit.  The action of sitting was not completed.  On the other hand, this is an example of completed past action:

On that morning, my mother *sat*.

My mother sat once, but since then she probably stood, walked, and performed all sorts of other actions.  The action of sitting was completed.  The perfect tense expresses this second kind of past action, that is, completed past action.

*Here's a mnemonic:*  When something is **perfecr**, it's done!  You leave it be, let it go, and do not touch it anymore, so that it stays perfect.  Your action is complete.

In Latin, the third principal part of the verb is used to form the perfect tense.  So, in the verb

*capio, capere, cepi, captus*:  to seize
