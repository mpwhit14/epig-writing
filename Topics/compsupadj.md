####Comparative and Superlative Adjectives

All of the adjectives that we have learned have been **positive** forms - that is, they are plain, normal adjectives, like "happy".  However, things are not always just "happy".  Sometimes things are "happier" or even "happiest".  These are called **degrees** of adjectives.  The three degrees of adjectives are the **positive**, the **{comparative}[comp]** (the "more" form), and the **{superlative}[supadj]** (the "most" form).

[supadj]: urn:cite:hclat:topic.supadj

A **comparative** adjective in Latin is formed by taking the stem of an adjective and adding the ending "*-ior, -ius*".  This ending makes every adjective a third declension adjective.  The *-ior* ending is for masculine and feminine, and the *-ius* ending is neuter.  For example, if we take the adjective "happy":

*laetus, laeta, laetum*

the comparative form, "happier", would be:

*laetior, laetior, laetius*

and it would be declined with third declension endings (*laetior, laetioris,* et cetera).  The comparative adjective is translated as "happier", "more happy", "rather happy", or "too happy".

A **superlative** adjective in Latin is formed by taking the stem of an adjective and adding the ending "*-issimus, -issima, -issimum*).  This is a first and second declension adjective.  For example, if we return to the adjective "happy", the superlative form, "happiest", would be:

*laetissimus, laetissima, laetissimum*

and it would be declined with first and second declension endings.  The superlative adjective is translated as "happiest", "most happy", or "very happy".
