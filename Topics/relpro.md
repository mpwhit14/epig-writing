####Relative Pronouns

A **{relative pronoun}[rel]** means "who" or "which".  It introduces a **relative clause**, which is like a sentence within a sentence.  In the English sentence,

[rel]: urn:cite:hclat:topic.relpro

The man, * **who** wears hats*, is very tall.

the phrase "who wears hats" is the relative clause.  It has its own verb - a relative clause is a complete thought that could stand apart from the rest of the sentence.  However, it is linked to the main sentence by that "who", which is the relative pronoun.

A relative pronoun, like ever pronoun, has its own case, number, and gender.  The number and gender of the relative pronoun should be the same as its **antecedent**, the word that the relative pronoun refers to.  For example, in the same sentence

The **man**, * **who** wears hats*, is very tall.

"who" is the relative pronoun, and it refers to the man, so "man" is the antecedent.  Therefore, the relative pronoun for "who" will have to be masculine and singular, just like "man".

The case of the relative pronoun depends on what the pronoun is doing inside the relative clause.  In our example,

The **man**, * **who** wears hats*, is very tall.

"who" is the subject of the verb "wears", so the relative pronoun "who" is in the nominative.  But what if the sentence were different?  What if instead the sentence said

The **man**, * **to whom** we gave hats*, is very tall.

Now the relative pronoun is not the subject of "wears".  It is the indirect object, so the form of the pronoun needs to be in the dative.  It is still masculine and singular, because it still refers to "man", but it no longer has the same case.

The relative pronoun in Latin is *qui, quae, quod* (the masculine, feminine, and neuter singular forms, respectively).
