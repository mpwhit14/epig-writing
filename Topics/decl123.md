####The Noun (1st, 2nd, and 3rd declension)

Latin is an **inflected language**.  This means that words change depending on their use in a sentence.  Sometimes the entire word is different, sometimes only a vowel changes, but most often, the ending of the word will change.  Patterns of ending changes develop, and these are grouped into categories (called **declensions** for nouns and **conjugations** for verbs).

There are five distinct patterns of ending changes for nouns (that is, there are five distinct declensions).  We will begin by looking at the first, second, and third declension, which are the most common declensions in Latin.

Nouns are grouped into declensions because certain nouns follow the same pattern of ending changes.  For example, the first declension of Latin nouns is identified by the vowel -a-.  Every ending in this declension includes that -a-.  In addition, sometimes the nouns in a declension share other characteristics:  the majority of the nouns in the first declension are **feminine**.  However, this is not always true!  There are a few **masculine** first declension nouns, and there are plenty of feminine nouns in other declensions.  While generalizations can be very useful, the only thing that nouns in a declension *truly* share is the pattern of endings.

When you look up a noun in a Latin dictionary, the entry will look like this:
			*puella, puellae f.*
This shows what declension the word is and its gender. The following are the dictionary endings and any generalizations that can be made about the first three declensions: 

- First declension
	- Ends in -a, -ae
	- Mostly feminine
- Second declension
	- Ends in -us, -i
	- OR ends in -um, -i
	- OR ends in -r, -i
	- Mostly masculine or **neuter**
- Third declension
	- The first ending varies, but the second form ends in -is
	- Any gender
