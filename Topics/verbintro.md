####Latin Verbs

When you look up a Latin verb in the dictionary, you will see a list of forms, like this:

*amo, amare, amavi, amatus*:  to love

These are the **principal parts** of a verb, and they show all possible forms a verb can have.  Each principal part has a different purpose, which has to do with its **tense**, **voice**, or **mood**.

We know that Latin nouns have different characteristics that are expressed by their endings.  Latin verbs also have certain characteristics that are expressed by their endings and their **stems** (the forms that come from the principal parts).  The five characteristics of verbs are:

1.  Person:  
    - first person (I and We)
    - second person (you)
    - third person (he, she, it, and they)
2.  Number: 
    - singular or plural 
3.  Tense
    - There are more tenses in Latin than there are in English, but generally, past, present, and future.
4.  Voice
    - **active** (The subject is doing the action, e.g. "I am walking the dog.")
    - **passive** (The subject is being acted upon, e.g. "The dog is being walked by me.")
5.  Mood
    - The mood of a verb essentially shows the degree of certainty about the verb.  There are three moods in Latin: the **indicative**, the **subjunctive** and the **imperative**.  At first, we will be working with verbs in the indicative mood - verbs that express something totally certain.
