How to embed pictures in leanpub?
Finished looking for corpus ref. numbers in Heidlberg Database

**22 November 2013**

Continued to add corpus reference numbers, where I can find them in the Heidleberg project.

**18 November 2013**

From the meeting this morning:
- need to be able to coordinate with vocab of the textbook (Dave Perretta is making great lists)
	- requires tokenizing and analyzing the text
- look for the ablative absolute on coins (full sentences that aren't really full sentences!)
- Exempla are really the way that we learn.  We need something we can grab on to.

Electronic resources in the classroom?
- if everyone has an iPad, how would a teacher do things differently?
- airplay, easy display switching
- collaboration:  class repository?
	- write a tutorial for github
	- write a tutorial for using critic markup
- content can be reordered depending on needs of class (two tables of contents to illustrate this)
	- write about how to create eBooks for iPads

Talk in the spring?
- how do we build ebooks?
- what is the benefit of using a workbook on an ipad?
- how do we use the visual evidence/annotation in a classroom?
- how do we share this stuff on a repository?
	- all changes are tracked and nothing is anonymous
- what about *in classroom* collaboration?

**1 November 2013**

Editing day.  Left off before IMG_5359.

TO DO:

- update inventory
- pics of Latin at HC
- review tagging
- guides

Questions:

- What are the abbreviations D O M in IMG_2314?  Deo Optimo Maximo?
- "EG EG" ?? IMG_2721
- "V V" ?? IMG_4789 and 4792
- gap in doc21,doc23

**28 October 2013**

TO DO:

- create a leanpub account
- pics of Latin at HC
- review tagging
- create guides for coins, names, etc

**27 October 2013**

Anything morphological really does not need to be linked to the text.  Nor do case usages really need to be linked to the text, if they are just one word (ablative of time, etc).  I would like to link more complicated clauses (subjunctives, relative clauses, etc) to the text - how?

**25 October 2013**

TO DO:

- create a leanpub account
- how to guides
- pics of Latin at HC
- review tagging
- change inscription to document inventory to be more specific
- create guides for coins, names, etc

Questions:
- What are the abbreviations D O M in IMG_2314?
- "EG EG" ?? IMG_2721
- "V V" ?? IMG_4789 and 4792
- gap in doc21,doc23
- expansions in doc19,23,30

**21 October 2013**

Should we add more data, or should we edit views of the existing data?  The image is connected to the text and the topic, but the text and the topic are not connected.  Should we connect them specifically?  It seems to make sense that the text and topics should be connected when it comes to complicated structures, like clauses or features that are split in the inscription.  With simpler topics, like morphological things, the image can suffice.

SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT:  How should the data be viewed?  At what point can it be entered?  I can see three possible presentations:

1. A guided view, that is sort of like a textbook.  An introduction to grammar with inscriptions as illustrations.
2. A collection of images organized by topic (basically what we have now).  Easy to find illustrations for any curriculum.
3. A guided view, but focused on types of inscriptions rather than grammar.

TO DO:

- create a leanpub account
- how to guides
- pics of Latin at HC
- review tagging

**19 October 2013**

IMG_7993 is Italian.  Oops.

**17 October 2013**

More tagging.  When I am finished, I should go back through and see what I missed.

**14 October 2013**

I am working on tagging and thinking about design.  What would be a good entry point into the data?  I like the idea of broad categories into narrow topics into images for sort of an index, but I also want some guided entry.

**11 October 2013**

Editing day.

Questions:
- What are the abbreviations D O M in IMG_2314?
- What if a word continues onto the next line?  IMG_2717
	-- <w part="I"> ?  YES
- "EG EG" ?? IMG_2721
- "V V" ?? IMG_4789 and 4792
- All abbreviations in doc19
- gap in doc21

Left off at image 5213, but the last three editions need to be looked at again and the abbreviations need to be filled in.

**6 October 2013**

I tagged some more pictures and began writing a how-to-read-an-inscription guide.  I want to include guides on Roman numerals, names, and dating systems.  I also would like to figure out how to cite images within markdown (citedown extensions).

TO DO:
- how to guides
- more tagging
- pics of Latin at HC
- clean up outlines
- tag 4580
- index texts to images

**4 October 2013**

Another editing day!  I left off after IMG_4580

TO DO:
- how to guides
- more tagging
- pics of Latin at HC
- clean up outlines
- tag 4580

Questions:
- What are the abbreviations D O M in IMG_2314?
- What if a word continues onto the next line?  IMG_2717
	-- <w part="I"> ?  YES

**30 September 2013**

I added glossary notes to the citable topics and to the concepts.

**28 September 2013**

TO DO:

- pics of Latin at HC
- how to guides
- add glossary notes to topics
- more tagging

Specific questions:  does "deponent verb" fit into a broader category?  What about things like purpose clauses/prepositional phrases?  Date?  Locative?

What sort of broad concepts should we really have?  How broad?  For nouns, case and declension makes sense.  For verbs, I have done tense/mood/conjugation/voice.  What about pronouns, adjectives, or adverbs?

I expanded the collection of concepts and created a topics-to-categories index.

**27 September 2013**

First day editing in the lab!
I created an index for people and I am adding places I come across to the existing sites index.

Things I am noticing as I edit:
- need guide to abbreviations
- numerals sometimes have a line over them to show they are numerals
- index for names
- need guide to common nomina abbreviationsâ€¦ maybe to nomina in general

I left off in the middle of IMG_2501.

**23 September 2013**

I should create a glossary of terms.  Add a third column to index of topics to explain what they are plainly.  **You can't explain something familiar with something unfamiliar.**  Also, create an index of broad concepts to link to the narrow topics - categories.

**22 September 2013**

I created an index of preferred images this week.  Today, I tagged more images and started a (very brief) outline for how-to guides about how to approach each type of artifact.  I need to do more research before I actually write them, I think.

I am trying to think about different ways to outline the materials.  I have one outline in the works for someone starting from the very beginning and trying to learn Latin from the material.  Other ideas...
	- someone who knows Latin and is looking to learn about epigraphy
	- someone who is teaching Latin and just wants a reference by subject

**16 September 2013**

I added my topical outline to the epig-writing repository.

*Things to think about*

- Index text by object/image/topic
- First, edit the texts
- Geographies on e-codices (Aethicus, Honorius)
- Different outlines for different ways to approach the material
- Directory of edited texts
- How-to guides for dealing with the artifacts as artifacts (**start this week**)
- Pics of the Latin at HC (**do tomorrow**)

**15 September 2013**

I downloaded a markdown editor and I am learning how to use it for my writing.

**13 September 2013**

I expanded upon the index of illustrations and learned how to push and commit with git, so the changes are in the repository.  I also set up my own repository for my writing and I am learning how to add something to it.

In tagging illustrations, I am trying to be as specific as possible.  I tag by case/number/declension or tense/voice/mood/conjugation.  I have also begun adding tags for prepositional phrases, clauses, different types of pronouns, and case usages.

It is my hope that if I am very thorough in tagging, I will ultimately be able to create a very usable teaching tool.  I would like to build a website that allows the user to search the images by concept and find all the illustrations, as well as searching by image or artifact.

**10 September 2013**

I am trying to download GitHub for Windows and struggling.

So far, I have indices for Location, Object, image to location, image to object, and tags.  A tagged index of the passages in *By Roman Hands* is in progress.  A tagged index of my images is in progress, though should probably be in further progress.

I also downloaded Fr. Vodoklys's publication about Latin at Holy Cross.  On a sunny day I am going to take my camera out and find that Latin!

**9 September 2013**

I have spent the past two weeks tagging images, reading By Roman Hands, and citing examples of grammar concepts (tags) from the database.  Prof. Smith got my images uploaded and we are moving to a new repository tomorrow.

Today, I need to create a list of monuments and identifiers and then link that with the images so that the images can be searched by context.  The idea is that it is pedagogically effective to be able to return to a monument over and over.  This gives students something familiar to hold on to - the more tangible things a student can grasp, the easier it is to remember the language.

We cannot forget to treat our artifacts as artifacts.

I am also looking for some nice, readable coins.  Left off here: `http://numismatics.org/search/results?q=department_facet%3A%22Roman%22%20AND%20imagesavailable%3Atrue&start=740`

###Statement of purpose

My goal for this project is to create a stable source of images with edited texts that can be used in a first-year Latin course.  This database will be searchable by grammar concept, monument, and perhaps others, and will be entirely available and accessible under a creative commons liscense.  I am also structuring a new Latin curriculum that teaches to the epigraphic material, with the idea that it is incredibly beneficial and interesting in a first-year Latin class to give students the opportunity to work with real Latin and real artifacts as early as possible.  In addition, teaching to the epigraphic material requires a change to the sequence in which Latin is normally taught, but this could also be beneficial for first-year students to gain more practice with concepts they will see more often in Latin texts (e.g. the perfect tense).
