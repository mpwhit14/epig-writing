####Introduction to Adjectives

#####Noun-adjective agreement

As was discussed earlier, nouns have three major characteristics: (1) case, (2) number, and (3) gender.  If an adjective is describing a noun, it must have the same case, number, and gender.  Often this means the endings match, but not always - for example, "angry girls" are "*iratae puellae*", but "angry dogs" are "*irati canes*".

Like nouns, adjectives are also organized into **declensions**.  These declensions are the **first and second declension** and the **third declension**.  **First and second declension** adjectives have the same endings as first and second declension nouns, depending on the gender of the noun which they are describing.  Adjectives describing feminine nouns use first declension endings (-a, -ae, -ae, -am, -a, etc), and adjectives describing masculine or neuter nouns use second declension endings (-us/-um, -i, -o, -um, -o, etc).  First and second declension adjectives are listed in the dictionary in their masculine, feminine, and neuter nominative singular forms, like this:

*laetus, laeta, laetum*:  happy

**Third declension** adjectives have the same endings as third declension nouns, with only a few differences.  The nominative singular form of third declension adjectives always ends in -is for masculine and feminine, and -e for neuter.  Third declension adjectives are also listed in the dictionary with their masculine, feminine, and neuter forms, like this:

*fortis, fortis, forte*:  brave

####Substantive

Because we can tell the number and gender of an adjective, sometimes an adjective can stand in the place of a noun.  This is called a **substantive adjective**.  For example, when writing about the *iratae puellae*, the phrase "angry girls" can be shortened to just *iratae* - since the ending on the adjective tells us that whomever is angry is feminine and plural.
