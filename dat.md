####Dative

The **dative** case acts as the indirect object of a sentence. This means, words in the dative case answer the question "To whom?" or "For whom?".   

Words in the dative are found all over Roman inscriptions, particularly when it comes to big monuments.  This is because the monument itself suggests the question, "For whom was this really big thing built?", and then the dative inscription can naturally answer that question.
