##Tufts presentation

Points to make:

1.  How my editing is done
2.  Things I have added on that are not just editorial
      - Digital editions can be worked with in **more** ways than print editions
      - Concepts and topics tree
      - Geographical data
      - Character data
      - Allows for viewing the texts in different contexts
3.  How do we organize and structure an archive for multiple kinds of use/reuse?
      - Multipurpose
      - My archive is open to automated analysis but also handcrafted essays (since it is citeable)
      - Textbook vocab?  Morphological analysis?

##Outline

1.  Editing Latin Inscriptions
      - Same process as the other projects
      - XML documents of transcribed text, appropriately tagged (abbr, expan, etc)
2.  Beyond Editing
      - Character and geographical data
      - Sections of images linked with concepts and topics
      - Morphological analysis
      - RDF
3.  The RDF Graph and texts in context
      - Many different access points into the material
      - Allows for viewing text in context:  geographical, historical, grammatical, linguistic
      - Structure is multipurpose, accessible, reusable - not just a textbook
      - Automated analysis but also citeable for handcrafted essays
      - Automated analysis from a pedagogical perspective:
            - What topics come up more often?
            - What inscriptions use vocabulary my students are already familiar with?
