##Outline

1.  Editing Latin Inscriptions
      - Same process as the other projects
      - XML documents of transcribed text, appropriately tagged (abbr, expan, etc)
2.  Beyond Editing
      - Character and geographical data
      - Sections of images linked with concepts and topics
      - Morphological analysis
      - RDF
3.  The RDF Graph and texts in context
      - Many different access points into the material
      - Allows for viewing text in context:  geographical, historical, grammatical, linguistic
      - Structure is multipurpose, accessible, reusable - not just a textbook
      - Automated analysis but also citeable for handcrafted essays
      - Automated analysis from a pedagogical perspective:
            - What topics come up more often?
            - What inscriptions use vocabulary my students are already familiar with?
