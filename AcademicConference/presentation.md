## Bring primary material into the classroom ##

- primary material makes historical language real to students
- immediacy of contact with the past

---

## Goal: resources, not tools

- organized body of citable  material
- adaptable: can be reused in any number of ways
- long-term: not dependent on one software


---

## Organizing the material

- the RDF graph
- unified representation of each piece
- simple format

---


## Source material

- original photography (CC license)
- digital diplomatic editions keyed to images
- prosopographic and geographical data

- allows for viewing text in context
-  automated analysis (e.g., morphology) but also citable

## Rethinking our curriculum

- find source material for a topic, or...
- organize curriculum in terms of corpus

---

## Experience of reading

- primary material from first encounter with language
- same experience as long as they study the language
- pedagogy and scholarship blur
