####Verb Conjugations

Latin nouns are organized into categories, called declensions, based on similar endings.  Similarly, Latin verbs are organized into categories.  These categories are called **conjugations**.

There are four (and a half) verb conjugations.  They are organized based on the vowels in their endings - this will be explained more later on.  The conjugation of a verb can be identified by looking at the principal parts.

**First conjugation** verbs have an 'a' in their second principal part: *amo, am**a**re, amavi, amatus**
**Second conjugation** verbs have an 'e' in both their first AND second principal part: *sed**e**o, sed**e**re, sedi, sessus*
**Third conjugation** verbs have an 'e' in their second principal part (and NOT their first): *lego, leg**e**re, legi, lectus*
There is a subset of the third conjugation that is called **third "-io" conjugation**.  It is so named because the first principal part ends in *-io* and there is an 'e' in the second principal part:  *cap**io**, cap**e**re, cepi, captus*
**Fourth conjugation** verbs have an 'i' in both their first and second principal parts: *dorm**i**o, dorm**i**re, dormivi, dormitus*
