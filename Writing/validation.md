##How do I recognize and verify adequate work?

How do I make sure my material is publishable?  First, the vocabulary must be tokenized and checked with a system similar to the MOM used in the Homer Multi-text.  Things found as mistakes can then be looked at against the image of the corresponding inscription.

Tests?
- vocabulary
- abbreviations have *correct* expansions
- texts match inscription

How do I verify the grammatical tags?  I know already that there are mistakes.  Can I do anything more than just looking at them all again?

- cases correctly identified?
- verb tenses correctly identified?
