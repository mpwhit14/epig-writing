##Guides to be written
- Roman naming

Abbreviations:
- origin perhaps lies in the naming system
- used for names, common words (filius, nepos, consul etc), titles of consular and triumphal fasti

Context:
- can date pieces from physical surroundings (if in situ)

Names:
- likely to reveal the status/date of a person
- some family names are more common in certain centuries
- praenomen, nomen, cognomen
- cognomen is descriptive, honorary or family-derived
	- most personal of the names
- women's names are the feminine form of the nomen
	- distinguished by genitive telling father or husband
	- maior, minor
- slaves took their master's nomen and praenomen after manumissio

Roman numerals:
- sometimes have a bar on top (symbolizes thousand)
- I=1, V=5, X=10, L=50, C=100, D=500, Q=500,000
- M=1000?  Never for the Romans, except in MN or MP.  Instead we get phi or infinity sign
- C with a line for 6
- S = 1/2
