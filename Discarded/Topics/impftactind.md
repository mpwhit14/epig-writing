####Imperfect Active Indicative

Latin has two different ways to express past tense, the **{perfect}[perf]** and the **{imperfect}[imperf]**.  The imperfect tense expresses ongoing or incomplete action.  That means, the imperfect tense is translated into English is "was doing", "used to do", or "keeps on doing".

[perf]: urn:cite:hclat:category.perfect
[imperf]: urn:cite:hclat:category.imperfect

The imperfect tense is formed from the **present stem**, which can be found in the second principal part of a verb.  If the *-are, -ere,* or *-ire* part of the verb is taken away, what is left is the present stem.

*amo, am|are, amavi, amatus*

The present stem of *amare* is *am-*.

Now, add the part of the verb that makes it imperfect: the *-ba-*.  This syllable indicated that the action of this verb is happening in the past.  This part changes slightly between different conjugations of verbs:

First conjugation: Add *-**a**ba-*
Second conjugation: Add *-**e**ba-*
Third, third -io, and fourth conjugation: Add *-**ie**ba-*

Finally, add **personal endings**.  These endings show what person and number is the subject of the verb.  This particular set of endings will be used over and over, so get to know them well.

Person | Singular | Plural
1st | -m | -mus
2nd | -s | -tis
3rd | -t | -nt

*A formula for the imperfect active indicative*: present stem + a/e/ie-ba + personal ending

So, to conjugate *amare* in the imperfect tense, take the present stem (*am-*), add *-aba-*, and then add the personal endings.

Person | Singular | Plural
1st | amabam (I was loving/I used to love/I kept on loving) | amabamus (we were loving/we used to love/we kept on loving)
2nd | amabas (you were loving/you used to love/you kept on loving) | amabatis (you were loving/you used to love/you kept on loving)
3rd | amabat (he was loving/he used to love/he kept on loving) | amabant (they were loving/they used to love/they kept on loving)

*A few key terms*

- **{imperfect}[imperf]**
- **present stem**
- **personal endings**
