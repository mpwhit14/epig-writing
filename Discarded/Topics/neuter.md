####Neuter

Latin nouns have three genders:  masculine, feminine, and **neuter**.  Neuter nouns are easy to identify in written Latin because their nominative and accusative forms are always the same.  Also, neuter nominative and accusative plural nouns always end in *-a*.

**There are no neuter words in the first declension.**
