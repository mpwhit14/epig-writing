####Case, Number, and Gender

Latin is an inflected language, so the endings of words change depending on what a word is doing in a sentence.  But what does that mean?  When it comes to nouns, that means that nouns have different endings to show when they are singular or plural, to show whether they are masculine, feminine, or neuter, and to show what their part of speech is in a sentence.  These three characteristics are referred to as the **case**, **number**, and **gender** of a noun.  All nouns have these three characteristics, and every noun ending indicates what these three characteristics are.

Two of these characteristics, number and gender, are pretty self-explanatory.  The number of a noun is whether the noun is singular or plural.  The gender of a noun is whether the noun is masculine, feminine, or neuter.  Just like in Spanish or French, Latin nouns all have a gender (even if the object itself is not gendered, such as "table" or "house").  While Spanish and French only have masculine and feminine nouns, Latin includes an additional gender: neuter.  However, words that are neuter are not necessarily ungendered things, just like words that are masculine and feminine are not necessarily gendered things.  

Basically, this means that even though the word for woman (*femina*) is feminine and the word for man (*vir*) is masculine, house (*domus*) is also feminine, field (*ager*) is masculine, stick (*baculum*) is neuter, and so on - the gender of the noun form does not really have anything to do with the actual gender.

Finally, the last characteristic of the noun form is its case.  Just like in English, Latin has different parts of speech that have different functions in a sentence.  However, where English expresses parts of speech with word order and prepositional phrases, Latin expresses the function of a word with different endings.  These different endings are called cases, and they are divided into five major sections that show a word's part of speech.
